Snappo is a Telegram bot that uses computer vision to identify clothing items in photos and helps users find similar products available for purchase online. Simply send a photo of an outfit, select which clothing item you're interested in, and Snappo will search for matching products!

## Features

- üì∏ **Clothing Detection**: Automatically identifies different clothing items in photos
- üëó **Multiple Item Support**: Detects and separates multiple clothing items (jackets, pants, dresses, etc.)
- üîç **Visual Search**: Finds visually similar clothing products using AI
- üõçÔ∏è **Direct Shopping**: Provides instant purchase links to buy the exact items you're looking for
- üí¨ **Interactive UI**: Easy-to-use Telegram interface with buttons for navigation
- üí∞ **Price Information**: Displays pricing information for all found products

## How It Works

1. User sends a clothing photo to the Snappo Telegram bot
2. The bot processes the image using SegFormer to detect and extract clothing items
3. User selects which clothing item they want to find
4. The bot performs a visual search using the LykDat API
5. Results are presented with product images, prices, and direct purchase links
6. Users can immediately buy the exact items they're looking for with just a click
7. User can browse through results or search for different items

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Telegram account
- The following API keys:
  - Telegram Bot API token (from [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather))
  - [LykDat API](https://lykdat.com/api-documentation) key
  - [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/) key
- PyTorch 2.5.1+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for faster processing)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tomer-mil/snappo.git
   cd snappo
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the segmentation model (this happens automatically on first run)

## Configuration

The bot uses API keys that can be configured in multiple ways:

1. **Automatic Configuration**:
   - On first run, the bot will interactively prompt you to enter your API keys
   - You'll be asked for:
     ```
     LYKDAT_API_KEY
     SERPAPI_KEY
     TELEGRAM_BOT_API_KEY
     ```
   - After entering the keys, you'll have the option to save them to a configuration file for future use

2. **Manual Environment Variables**:
   - Alternatively, set these environment variables before running the bot:
     ```
     LYKDAT_API_KEY=your_lykdat_api_key
     SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key
     TELEGRAM_BOT_API_KEY=your_telegram_bot_token
     ```
   - You can use a `.env` file or set them in your system environment

3. **Saved Configuration**:
   - Once saved, API keys are stored in `~/.snappo/config.json`
   - The bot automatically loads these saved keys on startup
   - You can update keys later by running the bot and entering new values when prompted

## Usage

The Snappo Bot is already running and available on Telegram!

### User Instructions

1. Start a conversation with [@SnappoTelegramBot](https://t.me/SnappoTelegramBot) on Telegram
2. You can either send a text message to start the conversation or directly send a photo containing clothing items
3. The bot will process the image and display buttons for each detected clothing item
4. Select the item you're interested in
5. Browse through similar products using the navigation buttons
6. Click on the purchase link to buy the product
7. Choose to search for another item or upload a new photo

### Navigation Commands

- **Next product ‚û°Ô∏è**: Shows the next matching product
- **Search another item üîÑ**: Returns to the clothing item selection
- **That's what I was looking for! üéâ**: Completes the search
- **Never mind, let me upload a new photo üì∏**: Starts over with a new photo

## Project Structure

- `handlers.py`: Main Telegram bot implementation
- `search_engine.py`: Coordinates search functionality
- `segmentation.py`: Clothing segmentation using AI
- `lykdat_api.py`: Visual similarity search API client
- `serp_api.py`: Text-based product search API client
- `product.py`: Product data model
- `constants.py`: Configuration constants
- `messages.py`: User-facing text messages
- `buttons.py`: UI button definitions
- `response_parser.py`: Standardizes API responses
- `response_enum.py`: Enumeration for API field mapping
- `env_manager.py`: Manages API keys and environment variables

## APIs Used

### 1. Telegram Bot API
Used for creating the conversational interface via a Telegram bot.

### 2. LykDat API
Visual search API that finds clothing items based on image similarity.

### 3. SerpApi
Google Shopping search API used as a fallback when visual search doesn't yield good results.

### 4. HuggingFace Transformers
Used for the SegFormer model that detects and segments clothing items in images.

## Tests

The project includes mock data for testing:

- `lykdat_global_search_response_mock.json`: Mock responses from the LykDat API
- `serapi_mock_results.json`: Mock results for clothing searches
- `serpapi_mock_full_response.json`: Complete mock response from SerpAPI
